        <h1>Online museum reservations in Florence: Buy online your tickets for the Boboli Garden</h1>
        <p>When in Florence, some of the major attractions that you must visit are the Silver Museum, the Porcelain Museum, the Costume Museum, the Bardini Garden and the Boboli Garden. Needless to say, no trip to Florence is complete till you visit these historical marvels.</p>

        <p>The Silver Museum or the Museum of the Grand Ducal Treasure of Florence houses a collection of aesthetically and historically relevant precious objects collected by the Medici family, with their own personal acquisitions and the Treasure of Saltsburg being displayed in the left wing of Palazzo Pitti. It is home to not just to the Saltsburg treasure but also houses precious Chinese and Japanese chinaware, hard stones, ivories, ambers, cameos and jewels of the Medici dynasty.</p>

        <p>Lying next to the Palazzo Pitti is the Porcelain Museum, which exhibits the existing collection of China belonging to the Medici and Lorena families. The collections constitute some of the finest examples of not just Oriental, but French and Italian chinaware, especially Sevres and Viennese china.</p>

        <p>The Costume Museum is any anthropological maven’s delight. Housing a collection of men’s and women’s costumes from the 18th century to the present day, the Costume Museum displays a collection of more than 6000 clothes and accessories by rotation. The museum is housed in 13 rooms right in the middle of the Palazzo Pitti.</p>

        <p>The Boboli Gardens are another beautiful contribution to the history of Italy by the Medici family.  Started by Eleonora di Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1550, the Boboli Gardens have been landscaped by some of the major designers of their times ranging from Niccolò Pericoli detto Tribolo to Davide Fortini and Giorgio Vasari to Ammannati.</p>

        <p>The famed Bardini Garden lies next to the medieval walls of the Palazzo Mozzi. Developed and designed over a period spanning more than 300 years, this huge garden between the banks of the Arno river and  the Montecuccoli hill is famous for its azalea field, bourbonian roses, green theater, hydrangeas and the Baroque and Anglo-Chinese gardens.</p>
