        <h3>History about Palazzo degli Uffizi and it's gallery</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
                The Uffizi Gallery, housing one of the finest collections of art 
                in the world today is Florence’s most visited museum. It is 
                housed in the Palazzo degli Uffizi, which was commissioned by 
                Cosimo I of Medici in the year 1560. The building, which was 
                initially designed by the famous architect Giorgio Vasari was 
                later on added to by Bernardo Buontalenti and Alfonso Parigi, 
                with its construction finally finishing in 1581.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0"><br>
                Providing The Palazzo degli Uffizi, which was built to be an 
                office of the magistrates of Florence started being used as an 
                art gallery by Francesco de Medici, Cosimo's son, who set aside 
                certain rooms on the upper floors of the building to be used as 
                a museum like structure where objects from his collection could 
                be exhibited. Francesco’s collection, which he started in 1574, 
                was eventually added to be all the succeeding Medicis, most 
                notably Leopoldo de Medici, who is credited with owning almost 
                half of the total number of paintings on display in the gallery 
                today.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
                It was Leopoldo, who is also credited with having collected the 
                vast number of artist’s self portraits in the museum, and the 
                gallery’s collection of miniatures, which is second only to the 
                world’s largest collection of miniature paintings housed in the 
                Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The history of the Uffizi 
                gallery and its collection goes back not just to the 16th 
                century, when the gallery was started, but to the 13th century, 
                whose art is displayed in the hallowed corridors of the gallery.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
                The Medici princes and kings kept on contributing to the gallery 
                from their personal collections till the 18th century, and ended 
                up creating a legacy of some of the finest and exceptional works 
                of art in the world that we can see in the gallery today. In 
                1737, the collection was made public property by the Medici 
                heirs while in 1782, all the artworks were organized into an 
                ancient picture room, with the museum’s arrangements finally 
                taking a more organized and concrete </p>
