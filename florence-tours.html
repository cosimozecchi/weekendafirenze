                If you are planning to discover the romantic region of Italy’s 
                Tuscany during your next vacation, then make sure that you cover 
                all the Tuscan regions famous for their historical and natural 
                beauty. While the jewel city of Florence is not to be missed and 
                should definitely get the lion’s share of your itinerary, the 
                Tuscan countryside of Chianti and the cities of <b>Pisa and 
                Lucca</b> are not to be missed. Also remember that no Tuscan 
                tour will be complete till you stroll along the medieval streets 
                of its pristine villages.</p>

                the Chianti regions. You can either ride through the valleys, 
                vineyards, towns, castles and woodlands of Chianti on a Vespa 
                scooter, Italy style; or have the adventure of a lifetime as you 
                survey this breathtaking rural landscape in a hot air balloon. 
                End the balloon ride with a marvelous champagne breakfast
